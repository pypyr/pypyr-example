        Both max and stop specified. if stop never becomes True, will loop to max.
        if you want reaching max without stop becoming True to be an error
        condition, set errorOnMax=True.
    in:
      stopWhenImTrue: False
      echoMe: this is step {whileCounter}
    while:

  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    description: if max is 0, loop won't run at all
    in:
      echoMe: if you see me, something went wrong, because stop was True before loop started!
    while:
      max: 0
