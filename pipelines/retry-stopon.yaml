# ./retry-stopon
# To execute this pipeline, from repo directory shell something like:
# pypyr retry-stopon
steps:
  - name: pypyr.steps.py
    description: this step will retry infinitely until the cmd does not return 
                 an error or until a StopOn error happens.
    retry:
      # will stop retry on these errors. All others will carry on retry processing.

      echoMe: this won't run because the previous step always errors.
