# To execute this pipeline, from repo directory shell something like:
# pypyr pype-recursion-child --context='counter=0'
# This pipeline invokes a child pipeline, pype-recursion-child. It's part of
# a recursion demo where a parent and a child call each other recursively.
# You can run this child pipeline directly, or you can run the parent as entry
# point.
