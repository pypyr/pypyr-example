# ./retry-sleep.yaml
steps:
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    in:
      echoMe: begin
  - name: pypyr.steps.assert
    comment: assert will fail until the 3rd retry.
             will sleep 0.5s between retries.
             on 3rd retry, step succeeds, and 
             pypyr proceeds to next step.
    retry:
      max: 4
      sleep: 0.5
    in:
      assert: !py retryCounter == 3
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    in:
      echoMe: end. you'll see me only after previous step succeeds.
