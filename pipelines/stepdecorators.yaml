# To execute this pipeline, from repo directory shell something like:
# pypyr stepdecorators --context "isRetry=true,isDebug=true,isDebug=1"
# Notice how the isRetry flag is used to influence whether certain steps run in the pipeline

steps:
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    description: the run decorator is optional. If not specified, defaults true.
    in:
      echoMe: this runs because although run is not specified, it defaults to true.
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    description: when run is true, this step will run. This is also the default, so you don't _have_ to specify it.
    in:
      echoMe: this runs because run is explicitly set to True.
    run: true
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    description: 1 means True.
    in:
      echoMe: this runs because run is explicitly set to 1, which evalues to True.
    run: 1
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    description: when run is false, this step will not run.
    in:
      echoMe: this will NOT run, because run is explicitly set to False.
    run: false
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    description: 0 evaluates to false.
    in:
      echoMe: this will NOT run, because run is explicitly set to 0, which evaluates to false
    run: 0
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    description: Empty evaluates to false.
    in:
      echoMe: this will NOT run, because run is explicitly set to empty, which evaluates to false
    run:
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    description: String formatting expression
    in:
      echoMe: this WILL run, because run is set to an object (list, in this case), which evaluates to true.
    run: [0]
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    description: Use a context property to decide if this step should run or not.
    in:
      echoMe: this WILL run only if isRetry in context is True.
    run: '{isRetry}'
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    description: Use a context property to decide if this step should be skipped or not.
    in:
      echoMe: this will NOT run if isDebug in context is True.
    skip: '{isDebug}'
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    description: run evaluates before skip does.
    in:
      echoMe: this will NOT run because run evaluates before skip does.
    run: false
    skip: false
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    in:
      echoMe: done!
