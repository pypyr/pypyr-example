# To execute this pipeline, from repo directory shell something like:
# pypyr contextcopy invalue="passed from the cmd args"
context_parser: pypyr.parser.keyvaluepairs
steps:
  - name: pypyr.steps.contextcopy
    comment: copy echoMe from the input context value of invalue
    in:
      contextCopy:
        echoMe: invalue
  - pypyr.steps.echo # this should echo echoMe, which now has the same value as invalue
  - name: pypyr.steps.contextsetf
    comment: contextsetf allows you to manipulate the value as you assign it.
    in:
      contextSetf:
        newKey: 'XXX {invalue} XXX'
  - name: pypyr.steps.contextcopy
    comment: copy echoMe from the newKey value
    in:
      contextCopy:
        echoMe: newKey
  - pypyr.steps.echo # this should echo echoMe, which now has the same value as XXX+invalue+XXX
