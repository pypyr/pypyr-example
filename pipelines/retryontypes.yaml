# To execute this pipeline, from repo directory shell something like:
# pypyr retryontypes
steps:
  - name: pypyr.steps.py
    description: this step will retry infinitely until the cmd does not return 
                 an error unless an unexpected error that is NOT in retryOn 
                 occurs.
    comment: retries 1 & 2 raise ValueError, 
             retry 3 raise KeyError.
             KeyError is not in retryOn, so will quit step reporting failure.
    retry:
      # will ONLY retry these errors. All other stop processing.
      retryOn: ['KeyError', 'pypyr.errors.ContextError']
    in:
      py: |
        if retryCounter == 3:
          raise ValueError("this won't retry!")
        else:
          raise KeyError('this will retry')
  - name: pypyr.steps.echo
    in:
      echoMe: this won't run because the previous step always errors.
